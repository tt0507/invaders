Extension 1:

Adding sound-effect to the game.

The first extension of the game is to implement sound into Space Invaders. The sound
effect occurs when either the alien is destroyed or the ship is destroyed. The player
will also have the option to turn the music on and off. If the player pressed the 'n' key
the sound effect will turn on. If 'm' is pressed, it will be turnt off.

Extension 2:

Keeping track of score.

The second extension of the game is to include a scoreboard in the game. Each picture of the
aliens are assigned a certain amount of point: 10 point, 20 point, 30 point. The aliens that are 
placed further have higher points.
